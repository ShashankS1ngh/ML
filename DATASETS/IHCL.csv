The staff works really hard to make sure your stay is just not comfortable but a lot more than that. The hotel staff takes care of your privacy, security and hygiene and they do a phenominal work.

We never felt the need to ask her for something, somehow she always knew what we or our kids would be needing next. She kept checking in and really helped with making sure our kids were happy, engaged with activities and relaxed. It made our stay a really relaxed vacation. We travelled with a 3 and a 5 yr old and she made sure we all felt safe, happy and taken care of. She helped us create memories and we will surely be going back to create more.
  We had the breakfast buffet at the Capitol Kitchen everyday during our stay of 3 days. Chef Mani did a phenominal job of making our taste buds tangle with the delicious food varieties he offered. Mr. Rajinder was exceptionally good with his customer centric approach taking care of us while we eat. Our kids as well enjoyed and loved the food, ambience, hospitality and the vibe of the staff.

"We stayed for 6 days at this Taj location in Chanakyapuri, Delhi. When we arrived at the Delhi airport, there was a Taj person who took us from the airport to the hotel all the time making sure we were comfortable and carried all our luggage to the car and to the hotel room. We did not have to think about anything while we had dinner at Taj Capital that first night at Taj. They had cold water bottles in the car and that really helped since the weather was very hot in New Delhi. When we reached the hotel, our check in process was very smooth and so was and checkout process at Taj. Every morning, our breakfast buffet had a wide variety of options from Indian to Continental. There was idli, masala dosa, different kinds of vadas, upma, sabudhana kichdi, puri chole, parathas, different kinds of croissants, muesli (tastiest one I have ever had), eggs cooked to order, sausages etc. One of the servers there, Prem, made sure that we had our masala teas every morning. He would make sure that we got everything we needed. A special shout out to him. Our rooms were cleaned everyday before we returned back. One day it was my mistake and I forgot to remove the do not disturb sign so they could not clean the room. When I requested them it was quite late in the evening but still a person was sent immediately to clean our room. We used to go to the Taj club lounge everyday where they served us tea and different kind of snacks like paneer pakoras and desserts like cakes and scones. We tried the Taj dinner buffet one evening and the variety of food and desserts is something one should try. Their mutton seekh kebab is worth mentioning - it just melts in your mouth. We had a great experience at Taj - just impeccable service. I would gladly recommend this Taj experience to my friends and family. Great job guys!",0.237846

 The experience at Capital Kitchen where I had both the buffet and a la carte dinner was also equally warm and welcoming. Great food and top notch service.
 The Deluxe room size is great for 1-2 people. Staff was continually sanitising the common areas which I was appreciative of given the covid situation.
 I also took the spa service where not only was the massage very good but they followed all covid protocols as well.

"The room was not supplied with shampoo or sewing kit the first night. This was rapidly remedied when pointed out and these items requested. Also there was some confusion about the delivery of our luggage to the room as the porters knocked on the room door rather than ring the door bell and we had not heard the knock. When I rang reception after about an hour I was advised they were sending luggage ""straight away"". Half an hour later our luggage had still not appeared so I went to the service desk and the problem was quickly rectified and all explained,- viz that they had attempted to deliver the luggage but there had been no answer. The staff were most apologetic and "" treated "" us to a fresh juice to make amends. Nevertheless it was an anxious moment for us . On the second morning of our stay we had to leave early before the buffet breakfast timings and the packed breakfast we were given on our second morning was a little meagre,- sandwich, juice, health bar and cake. But to be fair nothing could compete with the buffet breakfast. For these two points only I have not given a 10 .",0.127083
"The buffet breakfast is really NOT TO BE MISSED under any circumstances! Whatever your dietary preferences and food allergies there will be something for you. Staff are most helpful and attentive and I would give a 10 plus if I could. I particularly noted that service to customers with disabilities was excellent with staff enquiring what customers would like them to bring from the buffet bars. We particularly appreciated the range of food... all varieties of Indian Cuisine and also Western full English if that's what you prefer. This could not be bettered in any way! Dinner similarly had a wide range of culinary choices. 
 The Swimming Pool was a bonus and appeared well maintained despite its popularity with the pigeons!

"However, abysmal service - you had to wait for 15-20 minutes just to get a table for breakfast (they arranged extra seating in the basement). The options at breakfast were nothing to speak off - barely basic (we had just been to Hilton Abu Dhabi and that had more Indian food in addition to international cuisine than Taj at their breakfast). We also took the new year's dinner at Taj and they had to move guests around since they had initially planned some outdoor seating which was directly behind the DJ -- it was too loud for people to sit. 
 Overall, food had many options but basic and tailored to suit an internation audience by playing it very safe. On our return trip, we stayed for a day at Aloft Aerocity and the food there was miles above what Taj offered. Overall, severely disappointing. The only pleasant thing I would recall is one of the waiters serving Chai during breakfast.
 Taj has some very nice resorts (e.g. Taj Madikeri) but this one is primarily focussed on foreign guests who are happy with the wow factor but in terms of overall experience (be it food, service or value for money) this one is not so good.",0.178112

"This review is simply based on the worst experience we had during check in with 3 small kids having travelled for 7 hours. Before arriving I called and received confirmation that check in process will be smooth. Firstly we had a car accident while travelling to the hotel from the Airport which was a shocking experience and the hotel very well knew about this. Once at the hotel me and my family were held hostage by a staff named ""Nivedita"" and her collegue at the front desk even though the key to my room was ready- intimidating me that I double booked for the 3rd of Dec- one through booking.com and one through their website. I kept telling the staff that it is not the case and booking.com has confirmed cancellation- she seemed really angry and upset and kept talking about policies and # of guests- I advised her that I can pay double the price as long as I let go into my room and finally after a lot of whispering to one another we were allowed to go into our room- now close to midnight with 2 toddlers. Within minutes - I was asked to sign a paper which asked me to pay approx $450aud extra a night. I had no option but to sign as I would be out of accomodation if I didnt. 
 Until the last day I was told by many different staffs that booking.com didnt filter the cancellation through and showing as an ACTIVE booking. This is a seperate case I will raise with booking.com as this concerns a privacy and financial risk for customers even though hotel is telling me that 5 star hotels wont charge me if I forward them my cancellation confirmation but in an IDEAL situation this shouldnt be the case.
 This review is not to take a dig at the hotel but to let families with toddlers know what I went through. Also booking.com regards 12 year old as kids and hotel regards them as Adults so buffet will be adult costs. The rest of the experience even though good but the sour first encounter made everything else look fake. Sorry sharing what I genuinely feel.",0.010215
